# Getting started
This project is about SPMM-based Vector Processor Supporting riscv instructions

## rvv_processor_spmm
The sv code and testbench. Run on the vivado.

## Documention
The technical documentation and analysis of this project help you understand the working process of our processor. 

## Motivation
Our goal is to design and implement a vector processor for GNN acceleration. This document contains the baseline, dataflow, architecture, and innovations of the design accelerator.
